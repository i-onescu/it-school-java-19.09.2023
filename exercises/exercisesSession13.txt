1. Define a generic class called Box that can hold an object of any type. Implement methods to set and get the value inside the box.
2. Write a Java program to create a generic method that takes two arrays of the same type and checks if they have the same elements in the same order (pass different types).
3. Write a Java program to create a generic method that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of all the even and odd numbers.
4. Write a Java program to create a generic method that takes a list of any type and returns it as a new list with the elements in reverse order.
5. Write a generic method called printItems that takes a list of any type and prints each item. Use an upper bound to ensure that the list elements implement the CharSequence interface.
6. Write a method called displayFirstTwo that takes a list of any type and displays the first two elements. Use a wildcard in the method parameter.
7. Create a generic class called Box that stores an item of any type. Implement methods to put an item into the box and retrieve it.

ENUMS
1. Create an enum called Weekday representing the days of the week (Monday, Tuesday, ..., Sunday).
2. Improve the Weekday enum and add a method called isWeekend into it.
3. Define an enum called Planet representing planets in our solar system. Each planet should have fields for mass and radius. Include a constructor to initialize these values.
4. Write a method called getDayType that takes a Weekday enum as a parameter and returns a string indicating whether it's a "Weekday" or "Weekend."

SOLID
1. Create a Bird class with a method fly(). Extend it to create a Penguin class. Make sure the Penguin class can be substituted for the Bird class without issues.
2. Design a class hierarchy for shapes (circle, square, rectangle). Ensure that subclasses can be used interchangeably with the base class.
3. Define an interface for a worker that has methods for both working and eating. Break it into smaller interfaces to follow ISP.
4. Create an interface for vehicles that includes methods for driving and refueling. Apply ISP to split the interface into more focused interfaces.
