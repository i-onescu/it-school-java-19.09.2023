We'll have three tables: Authors, Books, and BookAuthors (as we have a many-to-many between authors and books, why?).

Authors:
    id (integer, PK not null), name (varchar not null), age (integer not null), country (varchar not null), city (varchar not null);

Books:
    id (integer, PK not null), title (varchar not null), published_year (integer not null), isbn (varchar not null unique)

BookAuthors:
    id (integer, PK not null), author_id (integer not null, FK to Authors), book_id (integer not null, FK to Books)

Please insert some values in all three tables and then try to query the following:
- Retrieve the books published in a specific year;
- Retrieve the authors born in a specific country;
- Update the published year of a specific book;
- Delete a specific book and its associated author entries;
- Find books that have the word "Database" in their title;
- List authors who have not written any books;
- Find the total number of books written by each author;
- Retrieve all books and their authors;
- Find books written by a specific author;
- List authors who have written more than one book;
- Retrieve books with their authors, sorted by publication year in descending order.
