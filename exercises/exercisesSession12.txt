1. Write a method named displayTodaysDate that, when called, prints the current date to the console.
2. Write a method named displayDateComponents that accepts a date as an argument and prints its year, month, and day components separately (date in the format YYYY-MM-DD).
3. Write a method named areDatesEqual that reads two dates from the console and returns true if they are equal, and false otherwise (format YYYY-MM-DD).
4. Write a method named isTodaySpecificDate that checks if today's date is a date received from the user (so the user type in a date, and compare that date with today's date, return true or false).
5. Write a method named displayCurrentTime that prints the current time to the console (format HH:MM:SS).
6. Construct a method named findDayOfWeek that takes in a date and returns the specific day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.) for that date.
7. Design a method titled daysBetween that reads two dates from the console and computes the total number of days between them.
8. Construct a method called elapsedTimeSince that ingests a prior time (in the HH:MM:SS format) as its input and displays the time duration from that moment to the present. This method should return X hours, Y minutes, Z seconds.
